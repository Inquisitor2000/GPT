# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** [Insert Today’s Date]

This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle information related to the use of the “Top Social Casino Finder” GPT and its supporting assets hosted on GitHub.

## 1. No Personal Data Collection

We do **not collect, store, or process** any personal data from users. The GPT is designed solely to provide publicly accessible information (i.e., a list of social casino websites) for informational and entertainment purposes.

## 2. No Cookies or Trackers

The static JSON and OpenAPI files served from GitHub contain no cookies, trackers, or embedded analytics. GitHub itself may collect anonymous usage data as part of its standard infrastructure. Please refer to [GitHub’s Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for more information.

## 3. Data Served by the GPT

The GPT accesses a publicly available JSON file hosted on GitHub, which includes non-sensitive information such as:
- Social casino website names
- Public URLs
- Brief textual descriptions

No dynamic data, user-generated input, or tracking mechanisms are used.

## 4. Third-Party Sites

Links provided through the GPT may lead to external websites. We do not control or endorse the privacy practices of those sites. Users should review the privacy policies of any third-party services they choose to access.

## 5. Children's Privacy

This service is not directed at children under the age of 18 and does not knowingly collect any information from minors.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in service or compliance requirements. The latest version will always be available in this GitHub repository.

## 7. Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact the repository owner via GitHub.
